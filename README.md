# My_Hacking_Checklist

It is a comprehensive guide that I use for testing the security of web applications. This checklist covers all major aspects of web application security.

Using this checklist, I can systematically identify potential security vulnerabilities. The checklist is designed to be adaptable and flexible, allowing me to customize it to fit the specific needs of each web application I test.

By using this checklist, I can ensure that the web applications I test are as secure as possible, reducing the risk of data breaches and other security incidents.
